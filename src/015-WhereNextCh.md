Moving On from Here {#wherenextch}
===================

Congratulations on getting this far. You should now have a basis for
understanding the issues involved in many areas of programming. Even if
you never use assembly language again, you have gained a valuable
perspective and mental framework for understanding the rest of computer
science.

There are essentially three methods to learn to program:

-   From the Bottom Up - This is how this book teaches. It starts with
    low-level programming, and works toward more generalized teaching.

-   From the Top Down - This is the opposite direction. This focuses on
    what you want to do with the computer, and teaches you how to break
    it down more and more until you get to the low levels.

-   From the Middle - This is characterized by books which teach a
    specific programming language or API. These are not as concerned
    with concepts as they are with specifics.

Different people like different approaches, but a good programmer takes
all of them into account. The bottom-up approaches help you understand
the machine aspects, the top-down approaches help you understand the
problem-area aspects, and the middle approaches help you with practical
questions and answers. To leave any of these aspects out would be a
mistake.

Computer Programming is a vast subject. As a programmer, you will need
to be prepared to be constantly learning and pushing your limits. These
books will help you do that. They not only teach their subjects, but
also teach various ways and methods of *thinking*. As Alan Perlis said,
\"A language that doesn\'t affect the way you think about programming is
not worth knowing\"
(http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html). If you are
constantly looking for new and better ways of doing and thinking, you
will make a successful programmer. If you do not seek to enhance
yourself, \"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
hands to rest - and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity
like an armed man.\" (Proverbs 24:33-34 NIV). Perhaps not quite that
severe, but still, it is best to always be learning.

These books were selected because of their content and the amount of
respect they have in the computer science world. Each of them brings
something unique. There are many books here. The best way to start would
be to look through online reviews of several of the books, and find a
starting point that interests you.
